# uploader

This is a very basic (private) file uploader and (public) host that's still in development.
You can only upload files with a key specified in the config,
but everyone can open the link.

## Notable Features

- Filetypes are automatically inferred
- Special views for text and audio files

## Building and Running

- Create a `config.toml` and configure your instance:

```toml
bind = "127.0.0.1:4833"
file_dir = "uploads"
domain = "https://i.nerixyz.de"
authorization = "Bearer <token>"
# Base64, Used for deletion links
# Must be 28bytes (224bit) long
# Use e.g. `openssl rand -base64 28` to generate
secret = "..."
```

- Build/Run the project `cargo b -r` or `cargo r -r`

## Usage

You can upload either by sending a `multipart/form-data` request to `/upload` (the first field will be used) or by sending a `POST` request to `/upload`.
In both cases a valid `Authorization` header must be used.

### Response

```typescript
type UploadResponse =
  | {
      error: string;
    }
  | {
      link: string;
      deletion_link: string;
    };
```
